# Android Design Patterns

ADP is a small project that uses the movieDB api (https://developers.themoviedb.org/3/getting-started/introduction) to fetch the top rated movies and show them in a list. The app demonstrates the implementation of the mvc, mvp and mvvn design patterns.

# Instructions

To run this app you will need an api key from movieDB. To get an api key you 'll need to create an account. After that you can create a file in your user folder, called gradle-properties and add MOVIES_API_KEY="your_api_key".
